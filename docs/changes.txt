  bug. (madbear)

2005-05-24
+ All Gantt charts now look the same.  The activity bars are color 
  coded to match the status color and the fill color is red for high 
  priority task.  So you can visually see the state of things. (madbear)

  sections (madbear)

2005-05-20

2005-01-27
+ ADDED language editor for multiple language support (dylan)
  It is completely backwards compatible, but people should refrain from
  editing the lang_XX files directly from now and use the editor instead -
  please cvs add the global_xx.php files once you have created them.
  Eventually I plan to phase out the lang_XX.php files.
  Developers should use the global text( ) function to get translated
  strings so the user doesn't get blanks if there isn't a translation
  available.
