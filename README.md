Netoffice
=========

Base Netoffice installation, but now (partially) working under PHP 5. It's now using the latest version of JPGraph.

**Note:** Check your fonts path and change it (if neccesary) in <tt>includes/jpgraph/jpg-config.inc.php</tt>. By default, TrueType fonts path in Debian is <tt>/usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/</tt>
